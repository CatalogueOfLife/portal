There are JSON/XML/PHP-based Web Services available for scientists and software developers to query programmatically the latest edition of the Catalogue and the Annual Checklists. Please note that when using Catalogue of Life data in your own system it is important to abide by the Terms of Use and notify the Species 2000 Secretariat.

## Main Web Service
