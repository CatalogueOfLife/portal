## Classification
A list showing each of the higher taxa within which this species is included. The COL checklist is organised in a single management classification, using a hierarchy that reflects an integration of taxonomic opinion for the purpose of arranging species checklists from different providers into one classification system. The management classification includes higher ranks appropriate for each taxonomic group.

## Distribution
A list of regions and countries in which the species is recorded as provided by the taxonomic community that contributed the data to the checklist.

## Environment
Environment in which the species is known to occur. One or more of `marine`, `freshwater`, `brackish` and `terrestrial`.

## Extinct Species
Indicates species which are believed to be no longer living (extinct). Most of these species are fossils.
All extinct taxa are identified in the interface with a dagger symbol (â€ ) preceding the scientific name. 
This status is provided by the taxonomic community that contributed the data to the checklist.

## Name Field 
An option to restrict search to a single element in a name record, one of: *Code*, *Genus*, *Specific Epithet*, *Combination Authors*, *Published In*, *Combination Year*, *Basionym Authors*, or *Published In Page*.

## Name Type
An option to restrict search to *Virus* names or to exclude them (*Scientific*). 

## Nomenclatural Status
One of the supported nomenclatural status values, indicating the status of the name under the relevant nomenclatural code (the set of rules for naming organisms within a given kingdom):
 *Acceptable*, *Unacceptable*, *Established*, *Not Established*, *Manuscript*, *Rejected*, *Doubtful*, *Conserved*.

## Secondary sources
tbd 

## Taxonomic Scrutiny
Information on the most recent review of the species or infraspecific taxon by taxonomic experts. It includes the name(s) of the taxonomic expert or editor (scrutinizer), who is responsible for the taxonomic concept accepted in the source dataset and the date when the expert or editor assessed the record. 

## Taxonomic Status 
Indicates whether a name is the preferred name for a species:

* `Accepted`: The name that should be used to refer to a species
* `Provisionally Accepted`: A name that is included in the list to refer to a species, but where more information is required to be certain of the validity of the species in question
* `Synonym`: A name that is considered to refer to a species properly known by an accepted name
* `Ambiguous Synonym`: A name that has been used to refer to more than one possible species. Pro parte synonyms.
* `Misapplied`: A name that has been incorrectly used by some authors to refer to a species other than the one for which it was established
* `Bare Name`: A name that is yet unplaced in taxonomy. This can be because there is limited knowledge about the name, it still awaits taxonomic work 
   or authors simply lack confidence in adopting the name

## Vernacular Names
Common names that have been used in different languaes to refer to a species.
