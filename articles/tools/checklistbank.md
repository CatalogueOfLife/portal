ChecklistBank is the Catalogue of Life infrastructure, it supports the publication, analysis, and curation of datasets with emphasis in taxonomic and nomenclatural data. It hosts all [data sources that contribute to the Catalogue of Life](/data/sources), which are primarily global species lists provided by specific taxonomic communities. Beyond its role in building the Catalogue, ChecklistBank supports a wide range of other types of checklists, such as national and regional species lists, policy-relevant datasets like the red or invasive species lists, and compilations derived from taxonomic publications. Through ChecklistBank, we facilitate the discovery, use and citation of these valuable resources.

ChecklistBank plays  a fundamental role in ensuring that basic data on species names and classifications can be shared and reused to support biological research and wider societal uses. It has been developed and maintained by the Catalogue of Life (COL) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).
