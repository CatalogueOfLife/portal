## COL API
The content included in the Catalogue of Life can be openly accessed through the [ChecklistBank API](https://www.checklistbank.org/about/API). 
For a few things, e.g. custom downloads, authentication is required via a [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)/[ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/) user account. 

### COL Releases in ChecklistBank
ChecklistBank hosts a wide range of datasets including all sources the [Catalogue of Life is assembled](/building/assembly) from.
Most datasets in ChecklistBank are not related to the Catalogue of Life at all.

The COL [working draft](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/3) and many [releases from COL](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset?releasedFrom=3&sortBy=created) 
are available and accessible through the API.
In order to access releases or any other dataset in ChecklistBank, you first need to know their integer dataset key. 
Read the [Datasets section](https://www.checklistbank.org/about/API#datasets) in the API introduction to learn about dataset keys for COL releases.
