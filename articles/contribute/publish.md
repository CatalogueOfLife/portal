## Publish data on ChecklistBank

### Catalogue of Life Data Package (ColDP)
For Catalogue of Life, the recommended exchange format for submitting data to ChecklistBank 
is the [Catalogue of Life Data Package](https://catalogueoflife.github.io/coldp/) (ColDP), 
a tabular text format with a standard set of files and columns. 
The format is a single ZIP archive that bundles data in various delimited text files together with 
a [metadata.yaml](https://catalogueoflife.github.io/coldp/metadata.yaml) file to provide basic metadata about the entire dataset.
