**The Catalogue of Life (COL)** is the most comprehensive initiative to compile a single, integrated list of all known species worldwide. It relies on a global network of taxonomists and informaticians to ensure accuracy and completeness. By providing a consistent and up-to-date reference, COL helps translate expert taxonomic knowledge into a simple to use and understand catalogue. It serves researchers, policymakers, environmental managers, and the wider public. It also supports users who manage their own taxonomic data and species lists.

## Vision

A world where biodiversity data is connected, harmonized and accessible, enabling our understanding and preservation of life on Earth.

## Mision

To forge a global community driven authoritative catalogue of species, through an infrastructure that supports open data publishing and use.
