# What is Catalogue of Life?

## An international collaboration
Catalogue of Life (COL) is a collaboration bringing together the effort and contributions of taxonomists and informaticians from around the world. COL aims to address the needs of researchers, policy-makers, environmental managers and the wider public for a consistent and up-to-date listing of all the world's known species. COL also supports those who need to manage their own taxonomic information and species lists.

## The importance of scientific names
As we study and understand nature, we need ways to communicate which organisms belong to the same group. The names we give to species are a fundamental tool that allows us to refer to these units of biodiversity. Knowing the name for a species unlocks everything that has been learned about its biology, distribution and relevance to mankind. Our knowledge of the world's species is still incomplete, but hundreds of thousands of researchers have worked over centuries to build this knowledge and assign names to the species they have recorded. Every day, taxonomists continue to publish new scientific names and refine our understanding of the world's species.

## The challenge of scientific names
After more than 260 years of effort building on the foundations laid by Linnaeus, scientists currently recognise around two million species, but the number of published scientific names is much higher. As taxonomists revise their understanding of each group of organisms, they re-interpret previously published species concepts and map existing names against the set of species they consider to be valid. 

## Our mission
COL brings together information from taxonomists studying every group of organisms to construct an integrated view of the names used for all currently accepted species across all taxonomic groups. The primary mission of COL is to deliver a freely accessible list of all species and show which species is referenced by any scientific name, but the tools and services offered by COL also enable taxonomists and other stakeholders to publish and revise species lists for any purpose.
