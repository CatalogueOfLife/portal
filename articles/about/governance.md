# Governance
The Catalogue of Life (COL) is developed through a collaboration between Species 2000, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These three organisations support the executive team that is responsible for project management as well as development and maintenance of the COL digital infrastructure. In addition to these organisations, the COL is a global collaboration with many contributors.

Species 2000 provides the residual legal body for the global Catalogue of Life programme, holding its Intellectual Property Rights, copyright, domain names, access licences, Memoranda of Understanding (MoU), taking responsibility for continuity between major projects and providing the ongoing governance of the global programme. It is structurally a federation, owned and governed by the participants that become its members.

## Board of Directors
Species 2000, and thus the Catalogue of Life, is managed by the Board of Directors (BoD, max 8 members). The BoD deals with international policy and business issues, appoints new Directors (to be confirmed in the AGM), appoints and authorises the CoL Global Team, including appointing the CoL Global Team Chair, and appointing and authorising the Executive Secretary. Directors contribute their expertise to the organisation and work closely with the Executive Secretary. The BoD elects a Chair and also appoints a Company Secretary. It usually meets two times per year, in different continents. The Board currently includes:

* **Dr Peter Schalk** (Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Netherlands), Chair of the Board of Directors
* **Prof. W. Alex Gray** (Computer Science & Informatics, United Kingdom), Company Secretary and Treasurer
* **Mrs Leen Vandepitte** (Flanders Marine Institute, Belgium),Catalogue of Life Global Team Chair, Ex Officio Member
* **Mr Francisco (Tjess) Hernandez** (Data Centre Manager, Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), Belgium), Member of the Board
* **Dr Keping Ma** (Professor of Plant Ecology in Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China), Member of the Board
* **Dr Edward DeWalt** (University of Illinois, Prairie Research Institute, Illinois Natural History Survey, USA), Member of the Board
* **Pr Thierry Bourgoin** (Mus&eacute;um National d'Histoire Naturelle, France), Member of the Board

## Global Team
The COL Global Team (max 20 members) consists of active participants who contribute to the taxonomic and IT policy, and to the design of the work programme. Team members bring in expertise in the field of taxonomy, biodiversity informatics and/or as Global Species Database (GSD) or regional checklist custodians. The Global Team develops criteria for selecting global and regional taxonomic content, ensures the project's liaison in the taxonomic and informatics communities, recommends a work programme to the Directors, monitors progress of work and deals with quality maintenance issues. It meets every 6-9 months, rotating between continents. 

Working Groups (max. 15 persons) may be set up by the COL Global Team for special areas. Two working groups exist: Information Systems and Taxonomy. The working groups are led by a member of the COL Global Team but may include co-opted non-members.
