## Citing the COL Checklist and data from ChecklistBank
COL's goal is to make sure that the COL Checklist and all content published through ChecklistBank have stable web identifiers and can easily be cited. This will include the following features (some still under development as of October 2020:

* Every checklist in ChecklistBank will receive its own [Digital Object Identifier](https://doi.org/) (DOI).
* Each version of the COL Checklist will have its own DOI. The information shared for each version includes citation of all contributing sector checklists and other sources contributing content. 
* Every name in every checklist in ChecklistBank will also have its own unique identifier and can be cited directly. 
* Every name in each version of the COL Checklist will have its own unique identifier that links to the corresponding record in a source checklist. COL will as far as possible maintain the stability of these identifiers between different versions.

[Users](colcommunity#the-role-of-users) are strongly encouraged to use these identifiers in all publications and other uses of COL data. Doing so enables COL to demonstrate the importance both of taxonomic research and of the work to build the Checklist.

COL monitors use of all DOIs associated with checklists and aggregates this usage information as part of the metadata for each checklist (including each contributing checklist in the case of the COL Checklist itself). 

Usage (including references inside publications) are then reported back to the contributors of the content, making it easier to highlight the importance of maintaining these datasets.
