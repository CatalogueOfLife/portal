# A global collaboration

## Community-managed checklists
No expert knows all species, so COL brings together lists developed by communities of taxonomists familiar with each taxonomic group. Each of these communities contributes a checklist that aims to be the best possible modern globally complete listing and classification for all species in the group, including all known historical names for each species (as synonyms). These community-managed checklists serve as sectors in the COL Checklist.

Taxonomic communities develop these checklists as part of their own research activities or directly for COL. Communities use a variety of tools and software to maintain their lists, but they all then publish a dataset on the Internet using formats and data standards that allow COL to process the data. COL supports multiple formats so that data publication can be as flexible as possible. COL [shares responsibility](/content/roles) with these communities for ensuring that the COL Checklist is current, well maintained and of the highest quality possible. 

## ChecklistBank
COL, in partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), maintains [ChecklistBank](checklistbank.html), a public repository that brings together the latest versions of the checklists for each taxonomic sector, along with thousands of other species checklists shared by researchers and other contributors. These include summaries from new taxonomic publications, national or local checklists, lists of threatened or invasive species, etc. Checklists published to this repository are readily discoverable and citable and can be downloaded both in their original form and in a standard interpreted format. All published checklists can be searched, browsed, downloaded or accessed via a standard Application Programming Interface (API). In this way, ChecklistBank serves as a rich resource for discovering how any scientific name has been used in different contexts. Some of the names found in these checklists do not yet appear in any community-managed sector checklist, so ChecklistBank is also a tool for addressing gaps in COL.

## Editorial tools
COL and GBIF have also developed editorial tools within ChecklistBank that bring together the contents of all component taxon checklists to form the COL Checklist, an integrated catalogue that develops and improves as the taxonomic communities work on each sector. At any time, users and applications can search, browse and download this expert-reviewed catalogue or access it via the same API that is available for every other checklist in ChecklistBank.

## Addressing gaps
The COL Checklist is not yet complete or up to date for all taxonomic groups and all published scientific names. COL continues to engage with taxonomists and taxonomic publishers to fill these gaps. In the meantime, the COL Checklist uses automated processing to construct placeholder sections of the catalogue and to insert names that are not otherwise included. These automated additions have not been formally reviewed by a sector community and may contain errors, but they address the need of many users (including GBIF) for the COL Checklist to handle all scientific names in a predictable fashion. All records in the COL Checklist are annotated to show their source and review status. At any time, users can choose to view or access either the entire constructed list or just the reviewed components of the COL Checklist. Viewing just the reviewed sections corresponds in purpose to historical versions of the COL Checklist from before 2020. At any time, users can switch between these two views, which can also both be accessed through the API.

## Measuring progress
COL aims to deliver the most accurate and complete checklist possible. To achieve this goal, it is developing a model that tracks multiple aspects of the review status for each name and species within the COL Checklist:

* Has a nomenclator or taxonomic community verified the publication details for each scientific name?
* Has a taxonomic community reviewed whether each scientific name should be accepted or treated as a synonym?
* Has a taxonomic community reviewed all species included within a given taxon (genus, etc.) at the global scale?

The last of these checks reflects the difficulty of achieving a fully consistent global view when most taxonomists for the group work only on a regional fauna or flora.

## Extended information on species
In many cases, the taxonomic communities that contribute sectors to the COL Checklist maintain additional information about their species beyond simple naming and classification, particularly on distributions and ecological relationships. COL aims to support efficient management and access for this more extensive species information, so users of COL may discover much greater detail for some groups than others. Where relevant, COL also links directly to source pages served by each taxonomic community.
