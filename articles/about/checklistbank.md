# What is ChecklistBank?

## Species lists
COL aims to improve all aspects of the management of taxonomic checklist data. COL's primary deliverable is the COL Checklist (with all its versions). The primary inputs to the COL Checklist are the sector checklists provided by contributing taxonomic communities. However, there are many other sources and uses for taxonomic checklists. These may summarise taxonomic publications, or they may have a geographic focus (national or regional species lists), summarise local biodiversity (park checklists, etc.), or list species that share a common attribute or importance (Red Lists, invasive species lists, etc.). The authors and maintainers of these lists have the same requirements as those communities that contribute sectors to the COL Checklist. In many cases, the expertise encapsulated within these checklists may contribute additional names, synonyms or novel species concepts that should be captured within the COL Checklist.

## Publishing and managing species lists
COL therefore aims to support the publication and curation of all these checklists and to provide a platform for their consistent discovery, use and citation. GBIF has for some time maintained ChecklistBank as a repository for its community to share checklist data. COL and GBIF have united their capabilities to make ChecklistBank a consistent foundation and repository for all COL datasets and any other publicly published species lists.

## Benefits of using ChecklistBank
All authors of species lists are encouraged to publish their work through ChecklistBank. Every dataset published this way will receive a DOI for ready citation and will be accessible through the same interfaces and API as the COL Checklist, ensuring that the contents of any checklist can be used within a wide range of biodiversity software and tools. COL will track report uses and citation of each checklist. Where relevant, publishing information to ChecklistBank will accelerate corresponding updates to the COL Checklist.
