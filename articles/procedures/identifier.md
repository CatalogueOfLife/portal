## TODO:
 - how we coin stable ids
 - link to blog posts
 - name vs taxon identifiers
 - tombstone pages, what happens when we delete
 - resurrection 
 - stable across releases
 - identifiers can change in XR vs base release. new id from XR will also be used in based release once the names is added there
 - id reports
