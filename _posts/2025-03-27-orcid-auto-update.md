excerpt: Adding COL releases as works to your ORCID profile
categories: DOI ORCID metadata citation

Catalogue of Life issues a distinct DOI for every release which embeds a lot of metadata.
For example [doi:10.48580/dg9ld](https://doi.org/10.48580/dg9ld) for the Annual Edition 2024.
Notably this includes all authors of all sources COL has made use of as authors of the release itself.
If the metadata of the sources contains also your personal [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), your ORCID is copied into the DOI metadata.
In that case it is possible to automatically push COL releases as works to your ORCID profile.

COL uses [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) as it's DOI registration agency.
In order to automatically push works, DataCite first needs once your personal authorisation.
If you are interested in this service, we recommend to follow the [ORCID guidlines](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006894594-Auto-updates-in-third-party-systems-DataCite).
