Using a new API for the first time isn't always easy. We encourage all users of the Catalogue of Life
to [subscribe to our mailinglist](https://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/col-users) 
and to post any questions about the [API](https://api.checklistbank.org) 
or any other [use of the COL checklist](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/about/colusage#ways-to-access-the-col-checklist)
or [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org), the common repository for taxonomic or nomenclatural checklists.

As we actively advance our infrastructure we will communicate major changes and planned outages in this list to our users.
We welcome any feedback on missing information or features, bugs, or suggestions for enhancements.
