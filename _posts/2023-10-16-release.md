Catalogue of Life (COL) is an assembly of expert-based global species checklists with the aim to build a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth. 
As a global consortium, we aim to address the needs of researchers, policy-makers, environmental managers and the wider public for a consistent and up-to-date listing of all the world’s known species. 
We are happy to announce that we have just published the Catalogue of Life October 2023 online!

The Catalogue of Life is now issued with a CC-BY license! The Catalogue of Life contains over 2,1 million accepted species. About 1.98 million are living species, and the rest are extinct. A large community of taxonomists, over 500 experts globally, representing 164 data sources is underpinning this global species list.
Although the Catalogue of Life aspires to cover all described extant species, there are still deficiencies for particular taxonomic groups.

A [detailed list of source changes can be found in ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/272972/sourcemetrics?hideUnchanged=true&releaseKey=267522) where you can also view changes between other releases.

### Temporary identifiers - Warning!

After publishing the release, Jorrit Poelen [notified](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/general/issues/100) us that there are changes in COL identifiers 
for common species like *Panthera leo* found on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q140).
Investigations then revealed 1.244.280 wrong identifiers being used for name usages in this release!

Please do not store any of these temporary identifiers as they will be removed from the next release
when we will revert back to the previous identifiers. You can identify temporary IDs by their length.
True COL identifiers only have a length of 3-6 alphanumeric upper case characters, e.g. `4CGXP`.
The temporary ones either are UUIDs with 36 characters like `800a45f8-6c31-4ce7-926f-78e71478f179` 
or are made up of 19-22 alphanumerical characters in a more condensed form, e.g. `2WCzPyn85NO4BdYFo8RJ`.

The names themselves and other data in the release are fine and have not been corrupted.
See [github](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/general/issues/100) for more details 
and our [name-ids](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/2022/03/23/name-ids) and [stable-ids](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/2021/04/14/stable-ids) 
posts for more information about stable COL identifiers.
