Since the new infrastructure went live in December 2020, Catalogue of Life also switched to a new algorithm to generate stable identifiers for name usages
which I have described in [this blog post](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/2021/04/14/stable-ids).

After evaluating the [ID reports](https://download.checklistbank.org/releases/3/76/unstable.txt) we generate with every release, we found that the majority of identifiers changed because 
either the status of the name had changed or the accepted name of a synonym had changed. 
The original idea was that such important changes should be reflected by an ID change.
But it leads to a proliferation of identifiers and forces users to constantly update their mappings to the COL Checklist.

With the [March 2022 edition](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/9812/release-metrics) we therefore change to a more conservative approach which only tries to evaluate the name alone. 
Status or parent/classification changes should not trigger any artifical ID changes anymore.
