## Layout types and corresponding yaml
You can set the layout in the yaml frontmatter. E.g. `layout: content`.
* `content` supports
  * `toc` can be either true or false and will enable the table of contents
  * `title` required and will be used for the large headline
  * `tagline` optional and will be used to show below the headline
* entry
  

## Extending markdown
Sometimes markdown isn't enough. In those cases we can extend with custom components that you include. Images with caption is such an example.

### Images with caption
```
# Headline
below is a markdown custom figure. This isn't generic markdown, but specific for this site.
include image.html url="https://via.placeholder.com/550x250" alt="Alt text goes here" description="My cat, Robert Downey Jr." # wrap this line in curly brackets and percentage sign
```
{% include image.html url="https://via.placeholder.com/550x250" alt="Alt text goes here" description="My cat, Robert Downey Jr." %}

## Worth considering when changing content

* The menu has a fixed breakpoint. If you add many menu items it will overflow on some device sizes. You should test this when adding more menu items.

## Icons
Icons are font awesome and can be browsed at https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free

## Example pages
To get started there is a couple of example pages. When copying them make sure to change the yaml frontmatter. In particular the `noindex` which excludes the page from being indexed by Google and search engines.

* [Long article with images and TOC](/documentation/example-long-read)
* [Site navigation page](/documentation/example-nav)
